# BCS_summer_project_SER
This is the combined repository for Team 4, for the Summer Project "Speech Emotion Recognition", of the Brain and Cognitive Society of IIT Kanpur.

Detection of emotions is natural for humans, but it is a very difficult task for computers, since accessing the depth behind content is difficult and thatâ€™s what speech emotion recognition (SER) sets out to do. It is a system through which various audio speech files are classified into different emotions such as happy, sad, anger and neutral by computers.

In this project, using RAVDESS dataset (which contains around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions) we will train an NLP-based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions, as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice. After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.
