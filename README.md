**Abstract**
Detection of emotions is natural for humans, but it is a very difficult task for computers, since accessing the depth behind content is difficult and that’s what speech emotion recognition (SER) sets out to do. It is a system through which various audio speech files are classified into different emotions such as happy, sad, anger and neutral by computers.

**Objective**
In this project, using RAVDESS dataset (which contains around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions) we will train an NLP-based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions, as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice. After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.
